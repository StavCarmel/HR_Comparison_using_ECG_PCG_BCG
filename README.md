# HR_Comparison_using_ECG_PCG_BCG
In this project I examined three different methods to monitor the heart activity. The "gold standard" is considered to be ECG, therefore the other 2 methods which are PCG and BCG are compared to the ECG signal. ECG records the heart electrical activity, PCG records the heart sound and BCG records the ballistic forces generated by the heart. All three methods allow to compute the Heart Rate signal of the heart by detecting the periodicity in each of the signals
